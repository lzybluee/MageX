     * AI is not attacking if opponent has a creature that can't block
     * AI is not blocking also if able if the damage the attacker will do will kill the AI
     * AI is not able to block with two or more creatures one attacking creature to kill it. Even if none of the AI creatures will die
     * AI attacks with a flyer even if opponent has a bigger flyer that kills AI
     * Opponent of AI has only 1 life. AI has more creatures that can attack taht do at least 1 damage than opponent has blockers. Ai should attack with all needed creatures
