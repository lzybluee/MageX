     * Hellspark Elemental (and probably other cards with the unearth ability) - If I unearth the elemental, 
     * attack, and then go to the end of my turn both the "sacrifice" and "exile" clauses will trigger and 
     * the game will ask me which one I want to put on the stack first. If I choose "sacrifice" first and 
     * "exile" second, all good, the exile part resolves first and the elemental is exiled, the sacrifice 
     * part does nothing afterwards. But if I choose "exile" first and "sacrifice" second then the elemental 
     * will be sacrificed and placed on my graveyard and after that the "exile" resolves but does nothing, as 
     * I'm guessing it can't "find" the elemental anymore and so it stays in my graveyard, despite the fact 
     * that because I use its unearth ability it should always be exiled once leaving the battlefield no matter what. 
     * The bug should be easy to reproduce if following the order I mention above (click the exile part, 
     * so the sacrifice goes on the top of the stack).
