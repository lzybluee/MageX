 * The power of the target creature is checked both as you target it and as the
 * ability resolves. If the power of the target creature when the ability
 * resolves is greater than the number of +1/+1 counters removed from Simic
 * Manipulator, the ability will be countered and none of its effects will
 * happen. You won't gain control of any creature, but the counters removed as a
 * cost remain removed.
