//    While Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, abilities that trigger whenever a
//    creature dies won't trigger because cards and tokens never reach a player's graveyard.
//
//    If Rest in Peace is destroyed by a spell, Rest in Peace will be exiled and
//    then the spell will be put into its owner's graveyard.
//
//    If a card is discarded while Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, abilities
//    that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even
//    though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities
//    that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's
//    first ability) can find that card in exile.
